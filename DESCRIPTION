Description: Programs to find the sample size or power of studies using the 
    Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD) and programs to analyze 
    such studies. This is a clinical trial design where 
    patients initially on placebo who did not respond are re-randomized between 
    placebo and active drug in a second phase and the results of the two phases are 
    pooled. The method of analyzing binary data with this design is described in 
    Fava,Evins, Dorer and Schoenfeld(2003) <doi:10.1159/000069738>, and the 
    method of analyzing continuous data is described in Chen, Yang, 
    Hung and Wang (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.cct.2011.04.006>.
